      # Creates an instance of +Model+ that is prohibited from accessing the
      # database*. For each key in +hash_of_stubs+, if the model has a
      # matching attribute (determined by asking it) are simply assigned the
      # submitted values. If the model does not have a matching attribute, the
      # key/value pair is assigned as a stub return value using RSpec's
      # mocking/stubbing framework.
      #
      # <tt>new_record?</tt> is overridden to return the result of id.nil?
      # This means that by default new_record? will return false. If  you want
      # the object to behave as a new record, sending it +as_new_record+ will
      # set the id to nil. You can also explicitly set :id => nil, in which
      # case new_record? will return true, but using +as_new_record+ makes the
      # example a bit more descriptive.
      #
      # While you can use stub_model in any example (model, view, controller,
      # helper), it is especially useful in view examples, which are
      # inherently more state-based than interaction-based.
      #
      # == Database Independence
      #
      # +stub_model+ does not make your examples entirely
      # database-independent. It does not stop the model class itself from
      # loading up its columns from the database. It just prevents data access
      # from the object itself. To completely decouple from the database, take
      # a look at libraries like unit_record or NullDB.
      #
      # == Examples
      #
      #   stub_model(Person)
      #   stub_model(Person).as_new_record
      #   stub_model(Person, :id => 37)
      #   stub_model(Person) do |person|
      #     person.first_name = "David"
